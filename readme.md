This is a parallelized Nth order ODE solver written in C++ which uses RK4. The RHS of the ODEs has to be passed as an array of function pointers. The state space variables are also passed as a N dimensional array.

## Update: 23rd June, 2020. IMPORTANT NOTE:
This current version will be removed shortly and replaced with a updated version. The updated version will use gsl vectors and will have more solvers implemented other than RK4.
